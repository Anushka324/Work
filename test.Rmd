## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(shiny)
#install.packages("shinythemes")
library(shinythemes)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library("ggplot2")
library("plotly")

set.seed(100)
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
p <- plot_ly(d, x = d$carat, y = d$price, text = paste("Clarity: ", d$clarity),
        mode = "markers", color = d$carat, size = d$carat)
p

htmlwidgets::saveWidget(
                widget = p, #the plotly object
                file = "figure.html", #the path & file name
                selfcontained = TRUE #creates a single html file
                )
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
